# Spotify Plus
Spotify Plus is an Xposed module that adds beautiful lyrics to Spotify<br/><br/>
This project is still very early in development, many features are still not implemented yet

## What Is Spotify Plus
For right now, Spotify Plus is an Xposed module that adds beautiful lyrics inside of Spotify. The beautiful lyrics are heavily based on the [beautiful lyrics](https://github.com/surfbryce/beautiful-lyrics) extension by [Surfbryce](https://github.com/surfbryce). A lot of this I learned from my other project of porting that extension to a [standalone mobile app](https://github.com/LeNerd46/beautiful-lyrics-mobile).

## Getting Started
Requirements:
* A rooted phone with LSPosed installed
* LSPatch for non rooted phones
<br/><br/>

3. Turn on the module in LSPosed and enable it for Spotify
4. Force stop Spotify
5. Play a song, open the full screen lyrics page, and enjoy the lyrics!

## Main Features
* Beautiful Lyrics!

For now, that is all that this module does. I have lots of plans for this mod though. The ultimate dream would be to have something like spicetify, but for mobile. For now though, beautiful lyrics was the most important feature for me
